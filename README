Description
==============================================================
Provides a basic sdk template for Alien Swarm including the following features:
- All specific Alien Swarm code is stripped from the project
- SDK Player with DOD model (from the 2007 sdk template)
- Player Animation State based off the Alien Swarm animation state
- Most of the Game UI is left intact. The campaign and mission select options 
  are replaced by a simple level selector (reads from maplist.txt).

==============================================================
Usage
==============================================================
1. Copy the scratch folder into your sourcemods directory.
2. Open scratch_sdk.sln in Visual Studio 2010.
3. A script is included to automatically copy the binaries
   into the mod bin folder (dllcopy.wsf). Modify this script
   if you want to change the output path (or remove it and 
   change the output paths in Visual Studio).
4. Compile
5. Check if binaries are copied correctly into your mods bin folder.
6. Either run pakfiles.bat (in the mod folder) or specify "-override_vpk"
   in the launch parameters. Otherwise some files will be overriden
   by the Alien Swarm files (for example, scripts/HudLayout.res).
6. Start the mod, open the console and type "map sdk_teams_hdr".

==============================================================
VPK
==============================================================
The Alien Swarm VPK files take priority over the mod files.
To solve this use either the "-override_vpk" or pack the files
being overriden in a vpk file (see pakfiles.bat/txt).

==============================================================
Sounds
==============================================================
When the file "maps\soundcache\_master.cache" is not present,
it will rebuild the audio cache the next time you start the mod.
When you make changes to sounds, you will need to execute 
snd_updateaudiocache.

==============================================================
Alien Swarm Consistency checks
==============================================================
ClientPrecache in client.cpp marks several alien swarm files
for consistency checks (ForceExactFile..) and prevent the player
from joining if the files don't match. You might want to change
these. You can also use sv_consistency convar to turn these checks 
off.

==============================================================
Customizing the Main Menu colors
==============================================================
In case you want to modify the colors of the main menu, the
following is a quick list of places which you will want to modify
because they contain hard coded colors:

basemodpanel.cpp - SetScheme - most panels get the scheme from this panel, so you can change the scheme res file here.

basemodframe.cpp
    DrawGenericBackground - Used in the generic confirmation screen (e.g. "do you want to exit the game"). Contains hard coded background colors.
    
sdk/gameui/vhybridbutton.cpp -> Used in flyout buttons (main menu buttons and other buttons that result in a submenu)
    PaintButtonEx - Depending on the style, a different color or size is used. Alien Swarm uses BUTTON_ALIENSWARMMENUBUTTON and BUTTON_ALIENSWARMMENUBUTTONSMALL.

sdk/vgui/nb_header_foot.cpp - Provides a generic header/footer/background for panels. Used in "Create Game" and "Options" menus.
    ApplySchemeSettings - Change back background color. Alien Swarm uses a blueish tint.
    CNB_Gradient_Bar::PaintBackground - Change background and border color

sdk/vgui/nb_button.cpp - Generic button class used about everywhere where vhybridbutton is not used. Contains some hard coded colors.

sdk/gameui/Optionssubkeyboard.cpp - Does not copy the scheme from basemodpanel, so you might want to change this.

Base Code Changes
==============================================================
Client changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_CLIENT_DLL 
- cdll_client_int.cpp: basemodpanel include
                       ConfigureCurrentSystemLevel: Changed "sdk" to "swarm" to prevent errors in console.
                       The other solution would be to change the ekv files in the config folder.
- view.cpp: basemodpanel include.
- c_baseanimating.cpp: FireEvent, AE_MUZZLEFLASH -> added fix for thirdperson (might not be needed).

Server changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_DLL
- npc_combinegunship.cpp: #ifndef'ed GetCitizenResponse() parts.

Shared changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_DLL
- Added ACT_DOD_ activies to ai_activity.h, ai_activity.cpp and activitylist.cpp
- basecombatweapon_shared.cpp: SetActivity fix from 2007, SetModel stuff (might not be needed).

Misc:
memoverride.cpp: removed _invalid_parameter_noinfo for vs2010 debug mode.

Gameui:
The following parts of the gameui contain specific code for alien swarm, they are #if 0'ed out.
The result is that the campaign and match making options won't work (since they are initialized empty).
Most of the this is related to missions/campaigns.
basemodpanel.cpp (OnLevelLoadingStarted)
vingamemainmenu.cpp (OnCommand, ShowPlayerList)
vfoundgames.cpp
vfoundpublicgames.cpp
